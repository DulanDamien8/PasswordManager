Testing

This is a project that I do to get familiarize my self with the C programming language and is by no means a secure implementation of a real password manager.

### How to install

1) Open Terminal
2) Type in, git clone https://github.com/DulanDamien8/PasswordManager.git
3) cd PasswordManager
4) Run gcc -o PasswordManager main.c PassPhraseSystem.c PasswordValidation.c nameValidation.c
5) Then run ./PasswordManager
