1) Fix the PassPhrase Login system, by making sure that it's prompted first instead of
   being prompted for the website name first

2) Then fix the passphrase system by removing the "Entire word is uppercase part"

3) Implement a word recheck feature, so users can't have the same word in the phrase, in this way
   they will have to have unique words for each word on the phrase.

4) Implement simple login WITH HARDCODED CREDENTIALS ONLY FOR TESTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF
   ACCOUNT RECOVERY WITH PASSPHRASE RECOVERY METHOD.

5) Implement the PassPhrase Feature to work properly so that in case users forget their login
   they can use their passphrase to recover their account.
